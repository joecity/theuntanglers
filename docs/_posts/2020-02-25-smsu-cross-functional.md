Scrum wants you to create cross functional teams BUT is that really the best thing to recommend in every single situation? Do we begin by trying to make Scrum work or do we begin by understanding value, the appetite for change & other things - before we get everyone into cross functional teams? Do specialisms have a place in delivering value?
